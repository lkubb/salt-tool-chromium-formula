Notes
=====
General
~~~~~~~
- Chrome/Chromium somehow comply to XDG spec, but forcing it on MacOS would put cache into profile dir in XDG_CONFIG_HOME. Also dotfiles are not really a thing.
- Installation from local source is possible by adding `file:///absolute/path/*` to `ExtensionInstallSources` in **enforced** policies.
- Distinction between managed=forced and recommended:

  + Linux: /etc/chromium/policies/{managed, recommended}
  + MacOS: (system) profile (plist in `/Library/Managed Preferences[/$USER]`) vs plist in `~/Library/Preferences`
  + Windows: `Google Chrome` vs `Google Chrome â€“ Default Settings (users can override)`

- ExtensionSettings needs to be `minified JSON on Windows <https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7532015>`_.
